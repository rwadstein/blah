# HashKit

Welcome to your HashKit! HashKit is a toolkit for working with Ruby Hashes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hash_kit'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hash_kit

## Usage


#HashKit::Helper

This is class contains helper methods for working with Ruby hashes.

## #symbolize

This method is called to convert all keys within a hash into symbols to allow consistent usage of hashes within your Ruby application.

    hash = helper.symbolize(hash)

## #stringify

This method is called to convert all keys within a hash into strings to allow consistent usage of hashes within your Ruby application.

    hash = helper.stringify(hash)

## #to_hash

This method is called to convert a object instance into a hash.

    hash = helper.to_hash(obj)

## #from_hash

This method is called to convert a hash into an object.

    #class definition

    class TestEntity
		attr_accessor :text, :numeric, :time
	end
...

    obj = helper.from_hash(hash, TestEntity)


Additionally an array of HashKit::TransformItems can be specified to allow mapping from nested hashes into child entities, and nested arrays of hashes into nested arrays of entities.

Example:

	#class definitions

	class TestEntity
		attr_accessor :text, :numeric, :time
	end
	class ComplexEntity
		attr_accessor :nested_entity, :nested_entity_array
	end

...

	#transform method


		#transform item definitions
		transform1 = HashKit::TransformItem.new.tap do |t|
						t.key = :nested_entity,
						t.klass = TestEntity
					end
		transform2 = HashKit::TransformItem.new.tap do |t|
						t.key = :nested_entity_array,
						t.klass = TestEntity
					end
		transforms = [transform1, transform2]

		#hash definition
		hash = {
				nested_entity: { text: 'abc', numeric: 5 },
				nested_entity_array: [
							{ text: 'abc', numeric: 5 },
							{ text: 'abc', numeric: 5 }
										]
				}

		#to hash call
		obj = helper.from_hash(hash, ComplexEntity, transforms)
	end

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
